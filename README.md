# Benjamin Portfolio ✨

A sleek, responsive, and dynamic personal portfolio website crafted with React, showcasing my expertise in frontend development and graphic design. This interactive platform features smooth page transitions, a dark mode toggle, and dedicated sections for my projects, resume, and testimonials, designed to provide an immersive user experience.

## Getting Started

To get a copy of this project up and running on your local machine, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have Node.js and npm (or Yarn) installed on your system.

### Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Bensaxxy/My-Portfolio.git
cd My-Portfolio
```

### Install Dependencies
Install the necessary project dependencies:
```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

### Environment Variables
For the contact form to function, you need to set up environment variables for EmailJS. Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the following:

```
VITE_EMAILJS_SERVICE_ID=your_emailjs_service_id
VITE_EMAILJS_TEMPLATE_ID=your_emailjs_template_id
VITE_EMAILJS_PUBLIC_KEY_ID=your_emailjs_public_key
```
Replace `your_emailjs_service_id`, `your_emailjs_template_id`, and `your_emailjs_public_key` with your actual EmailJS credentials.

## Usage

After completing the installation and setting up environment variables, you can run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

The application will typically be accessible at `http://localhost:5173/` (or another port if 5173 is in use).

Explore the different sections of the portfolio to see various web development and graphic design projects, learn more about my background and skills, view testimonials from past collaborations, and easily get in touch through the contact form.
