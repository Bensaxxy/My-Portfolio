## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the project locally on your machine.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Bensaxxy/My-Portfolio.git
    cd My-Portfolio
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies**:
    Navigate into the project directory and install the necessary Node.js packages.
    ```bash
    npm install
    # or
    # yarn install
    ```

### Environment Variables

This project utilizes `EmailJS` for the contact form functionality. You need to configure the following environment variables. Although `EmailJS` keys are often used directly in client-side code, for production deployments, it's recommended to secure them appropriately.

Please note that `EmailJS` configuration for public keys (`GAXCU8JPlXM1IbX3s`) is typically handled directly in the `Mail.jsx` component for client-side use. For server-side operations or more sensitive keys, environment variables would be crucial.

For client-side `EmailJS` integration as seen in `src/Components/Pages/Contact/Mail.jsx`, the following values are embedded:

*   **Service ID**: `service_hzp7jdv`
*   **Template ID**: `template_w8mzxpg`
*   **Public Key**: `GAXCU8JPlXM1IbX3s`

No `.env` file or explicit environment variables are strictly *required* for local development based on the current code structure for EmailJS as the keys are hardcoded in `Mail.jsx`. However, for a production setup, consider using a `.env` file and a build process that injects these, or proxying through a backend if security is a major concern.

## Usage

To run the project in development mode:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
# yarn dev
```

This command will start the development server, typically at `http://localhost:5173`. Open your web browser and navigate to this URL to view the application. The page will automatically reload if you make changes to the source code.

To build the project for production:

```bash
npm run build
# or
# yarn build
```

This command compiles the application into static files in the `dist` directory, ready for deployment.
